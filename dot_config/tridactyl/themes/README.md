# base16-tridactyl
Base16 Themes for the firefox [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) plugin

clone this repo and copy themes into your tridactyl themes folder. Use `:help colourscheme` and `:help source` to figure out where to put your themes folder - see the tridactyl FAQ for more info.

Be sure to reload the page for the theme to take effect.

The current themes are all based on the shydactyl theme. If you want the default theme with base16 colours, I will get around to it eventually. Feel free to post a pull request.
